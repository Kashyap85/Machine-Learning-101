# Machine-Learning 101

I am making a Machine Learning repo. where I will upload several datasets and its solution with explanation. Starting from the basic and moving up in difficulty level.

Focusing on both the classification and regression, I have selected following dataset's on which I would be working on. 

<b><h3>Classification:</h3></b>
    	1) Iris :heavy_check_mark:<br/> 
    	2) Titanic :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	3) Education dataset :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	4) MNIST :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	5) Hand SIGNS :heavy_check_mark:<br/> 
<b><h3>Regression:</b></h3>
    	1) Boston housing :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	2) Red Wine :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	3) Medical cost personal dataset :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	4) Car price prediction :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	5) Human Resource Data Set<br/>
    	6) New York stock exchange data<br/>
    	7) Deep fake detection<br/>
        
<b>Classification</b>
First, if you have a classification problem “which is predicting the class of a given input”.
<b>Slow but accurate</b><br>
- Non-linear SVM<br>
- Random Forest<br>
- Neural Network (needs a lot of data points)<br>
- Gradient Boosting Tree (similar to Random Forest, but easier to overfit)<br>
<b>Fast</b><br>
- Explainable models: Decision Tree and Logistic Regression<br>
- Non-explainable Models: Linear SVM and Naive Bayes<br>        

<b>Regression</b>
If you have a regression problem “which is predicting a continuous value like predicting prices of a house given the features of the house like size, number of rooms, etc”.
<b>Accurate but slow</b><br>
- Random Forest<br>
- Neural Network (needs a lot of data points)<br>
- Gradient Boosting Tree (similar to Random Forest, but easier to overfit)<br>
<b>Fast</b><br>
- Decision Tree<br>
- Linear Regression<br>
