# Machine-Learning 101

I am making a Machine Learning repo. where I will upload several datasets and its solution with explanation. Starting from the basic and moving up in difficulty level.

Focusing on both the classification and regression, I have selected following dataset's on which I would be working on. 

Classification:<br/>
	1) Iris <br/>
	2) Titanic <br/>
	3) Education dataset <br/>
	4) MNIST <br/>
	5) Numbers by fingers  <br/>
Regression:<br/>
	1) Boston housing<br/>
	2) Medical cost presonal dataset<br/>
	3) Red Wine<br/>
	4) Car price prediction <br/>
	5) Human Resource Data Set<br/>
	6) New York stock exchange data<br/>
	7) Deep fake detection<br/>

Pull requests always welcomed ! :)
