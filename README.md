I am making a Machine Learning repo. where I will upload several datasets and its solution with explanation. Starting from the basic and moving up in difficulty level.

Focusing on both the classification and regression, I have selected following dataset's on which I would be working on.

		1) Boston housing
		2) Medical cost presonal dataset
		3) Red Wine
