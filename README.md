# Machine-Learning 101

I am making a Machine Learning repo. where I will upload several datasets and its solution with explanation. Starting from the basic and moving up in difficulty level.

Focusing on both the classification and regression, I have selected following dataset's on which I would be working on. 

<b><h3>Classification:</h3></b>
    	1) Iris :heavy_check_mark:<br/> 
    	2) Titanic :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	3) Education dataset :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	4) MNIST :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	5) Hand SIGNS :heavy_check_mark:<br/> 
<b><h3>Regression:</b></h3>
    	1) Boston housing :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	2) Medical cost presonal dataset<br/>
    	3) Red Wine :heavy_check_mark:<br/>
    	4) Car price prediction <br/>
    	5) Human Resource Data Set<br/>
    	6) New York stock exchange data<br/>
    	7) Deep fake detection<br/>
<b><h3>Pull requests always welcomed ! :) </h3></b>
<b>You may add your datasets with solutions, or can request us to give their solutions. Happy Coding!! </b>
